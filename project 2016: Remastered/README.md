# Project 2016 is coming back and better than ever ðŸ˜ˆ 
- Love project 2016?
- Want a less buggy and a better version?
## check this out:
```lua
print("coming soon!")
```
# Credits:
- cola (did most/almost all of the scripting for the original)
- spec (fixed a huge amount of bugs so now it works better lol) (also made the original idea)
